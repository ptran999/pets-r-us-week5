                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <p class="mission-text">Pets-R-Us began its first location in Bellevue, Nebraska, a few years ago to provide professional care and assistance for pets at home. 
                We are carving out a new path beyond what traditional pet stores care to do. Pets-R-Us values your pets and understands how much they mean to you.
                 We not only provide excellent services such as Pet sitting, dog walking, pet boarding, pet daycare, pet grooming, pet training, and transportation. 
                </p>
                <p class="mission-text">After a short period, Pet-R-Us quickly gained support from the local community.
                  By thanking our beloved customers, we expand our business with one more location at Omaha, NE with more services and care to provide easy access for our dear customers.
                   With every location, Pet-R-Us commit to fulfill the requirements of customers's needs in a pleasantly way.

          <p class="testimonial-text">It was a fantastic experience from the moment I walked through the door! Kelly always my favorite groomer. 
            She greeted us and patiently answered all of our questions. 
            The staff here are so friendly and seem genuinely happy to be in their jobs grooming our pets! 
            Also, we couldnâ€™t help noticing the fresh, clean smell of the salon!</p>

          <p class="testimonial-text">I absolutely loved the service! Once I walked in everyone was so nice and very accommodating. 
            My puppy didn't loose her mind and I was very pleased with the results. Prices seem to depend on the condition of the pets hair. 
            It was not too far from my place, we will come back. </p>

        <div>
          <p class="testimonial-text">My dog and I love this place. They are so nice to me from the very first time I walked in and didn't realize that we can have the services with or without appointments
            They were able to take in my dog and gave her a nice polished grooming. The first time I took my dog she was nervous due to that she doesn't like water and cried when I left her.
             Now I know she feels comfortable when I drop her off because she doesn't cry at all. 
            She always comes home smelling so good and her hair cut just right. I'm so happy I found this place.</p>
